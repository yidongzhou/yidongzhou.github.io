Thrilled to announce that our paper, [Deep Fréchet Regression](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2025.2507982), has been accepted for publication in the **Journal of the American Statistical Association**. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework for Fréchet regression, enabling flexible modeling of complex regression relationships where responses are random objects in general metric spaces.
