I am delighted to share that two of our papers have been accepted for presentation at **NeurIPS 2025**.
- [Fr√©chet Geodesic Boosting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18013): We introduce FGBoost, a gradient boosting framework designed to intrinsically model complex regression relationships with non-Euclidean outputs in geodesic metric spaces.
- [Wasserstein Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17404): We propose a novel transfer learning framework for regression where outputs are probability distributions residing in the Wasserstein space.
