👋 Hi! I'm Yidong Zhou, a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), working with Professor [Hans-Georg Müller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in March 2024, also under his guidance. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019. In addition to my academic research, I gained industry experience as a summer intern at Amazon in 2022.

🔍 My research develops statistical methodologies that harness the **intrinsic geometric structure** of complex data. As modern data collection expands beyond traditional settings, new challenges arise in analyzing structured data types, including probability distributions, networks, trees, functional data, and data residing on manifolds such as compositional data and symmetric positive-definite matrices. Due to the **lack of algebraic operations** such as addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication, conventional statistical methods designed for Euclidean spaces often fail to capture the geometry and dependencies intrinsic to these data. My work addresses this gap by designing statistical models that are intrinsically aligned with the data's geometric structure, encompassing **causal inference**, **deep learning**, and **Fréchet regression**. These approaches facilitate robust inference and learning across diverse applications, including longitudinal studies, social science, and biomedical research.

🤝 I am always open to collaborations and enthusiastic about exploring new research directions. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together!

🚀 **I will be on the academic job market for the 2025-2026 cycle and would be happy to discuss any opportunities!**
