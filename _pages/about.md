üëã Hi! I'm Yidong Zhou, a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), working with Professor [Hans-Georg M√ºller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in March 2024, also under his guidance. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019. In addition to my academic research, I gained industry experience as a summer intern at Amazon in 2022.

üîç My research develops statistical methodologies that harness the **intrinsic geometric structure** of complex data. As modern data collection expands beyond traditional settings, new challenges arise in analyzing structured data types, including functional data, networks, trees, probability distributions, and data residing on manifolds such as compositional data and symmetric positive-definite matrices. Conventional statistical methods, often designed for Euclidean spaces, fail to capture the rich geometry and dependencies inherent in these data types. My work addresses this gap by designing statistical models that are intrinsically aligned with the data's geometric structure, encompassing **regression**, **causal inference**, and **deep learning**. These approaches facilitate robust inference and learning across diverse applications, including longitudinal studies, network science, and biomedical research.

ü§ù I am always open to collaborations and enthusiastic about exploring new research directions. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together!

üöÄ **I will be on the academic job market for the 2025-2026 cycle and would be happy to discuss any opportunities!**
